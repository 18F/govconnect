The amount and types of stakeholders that are involved in a new agile workforce program differ based on the agency and overall scope of the program. These stakeholders include:

* [Mentors]
* [Applicants]
* [Supervisors]
* [Senior Executive Support]

The most important group of stakeholders however is the team behind the agile workforce program. This team doesn’t need to be large to do the design, planning, and launching of the program, however it does take one that is dedicated and engaged. Several key roles make up this program team:

###Program Lead(s)###
The program lead(s) are dedicated employees that desire to introduce a new way of working within their agency. These lead know that the current method of getting work done isn’t supporting the agency workforce anymore and a new way of working is needed to recruit and retain new staff, as well as meet the demands of the modern day.

###Program Sponsor###
Every agile workforce program needs one or more sponsors to help a program team gather the necessary information and to approve of their efforts. These sponsors will lower the internal barriers to assist the program team in meeting with other stakeholders around the agency and review the work products that team creates as it designs and plans the program.

###Program Team Members###
Every program team needs helping hands to get a new program up and running. These are other employees who are passionate about getting an agile workforce program going at their agency. They may not be able to lead the initiative due to other work responsibilities, but may have a few spare hours in a week to lend a hand.

It’s important that every program team takes the time to include the stakeholders described below to co-design the program together. This is vital for the program to have a human centered approach and to validate early concepts before they become fully established as core components of the agile workforce program.

##Mentors##
Mentoring is usually a formal or an informal relationship between two people, which occurs for some time, usually between a senior employee and a junior protege’, usually someone who is not directly supervised by the mentor, according to an [OPM best-practices guide](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/training-and-development/career-development/bestpractices-mentoring.pdf).

Mentors are key in many instances to alerting colleagues about opportunities to expand their expertise and gain valuable professional development experience. The relationship affords an opportunity for knowledge sharing between inexperienced and senior team members and contributes to enhancing branding of the organization by signaling your organization values employee development.

In the federal government, mentoring can be a precursor for additional career development or participation in formal programs including the Executive Leadership Program, the Presidential Management Program, and the Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program, according to OPM.

“Some mentor programs have flourished. The Environmental Protection Agency’s Skills Marketplace has become established within the EPA as an effective resource for managers. Open Opportunities has grown dramatically and is now open to all federal employees,” according to a [September 2015 blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/01/govconnect-launch/) published by 18F about the GovConnect initiative.

The aim of GovConnect to help agency leaders connect their employees to innovative work on a part-time basis, to one another, and to their agency’s mission.

In a successful mentoring relationship, the mentor and mentee both find great satisfaction. Among the common outcomes are:

* Developed coaching and leadership skills for the mentor as well as reinforcement of their own knowledge and career goals
* An ability to grow for the mentee by experimenting, learning and trying new approaches in a safe environment

##Applicants##
A common mistake many pilot programs make is trying to create a program that is meant for every employee. While this is a good long-term goal, at first it’s best to focus on one or two specific types of applicants and project submitters. An artifact that can help a team determine who is the person they are creating this pilot for is a User Profile. These profiles should include basic demographic information about the type of person that would apply for a project or create a new project. Additionally, behavioral information should be included that speaks to why that type of person would want to apply for a project or create a new project. The below format can help teams quickly create the artifact and then use it to guide future decision on how the pilot should be planned, designed, and marketed.

###Senior Executive Support###

* What mechanisms are in place to gain the commitment and support of senior leadership? Has senior leadership helped define the mentoring program?
* Leadership training available to guide prospective mentors as they work with more inexperienced colleagues?
* What ways will the senior leadership define clear goals?

###Supervisors###
* What are the problem and concerns of supervisors?
* How can those fears be resolved or mitigated?
* What training do supervisors need to learn how to work in new way?

###Union Relations###
* What ways can you draw upon the experiences of union leaders?
* Are there documents or other measures available to protect employees and ensure confidentiality during mentoring conversations?
* What ways will union representatives define clear goals?
* How can unions be included in the planning and design of a program?
* How can you address common concerns from unions?

###Project Lead Checklist##
Every team needs a leader, someone who is able to carry the torch and keep the path clear for the other team members to be successful. One artifact that helps teams set up their program faster and more efficiently is a Project Lead Checklist. This checklist gives the team leader a run down of all the things they need to get done or delegate to other team members to get a pilot started. This checklist is different for every team and for every agency due to internal organization and culture considerations, but below we’ve provided a baseline to modify based on the team’s goals and needs.

####New Pilot Checklist####
*Team Creation*
- Locate two to three co-workers to assist with program planning and administration
- Define roles for team members
- Team members made up of cross department/cross discipline representation
- Locate a mentor to guide the team
- Define a plan for ownership transition if pilot gets approval to become fully supported program

*Problem Statement*
- Meet with department leaders and supervisors to explore problem space
- Meet with union representatives to understand concerns
- Host a workshop collectively define the problem that needs to be solved with representatives from management, supervisors, and unions.
- Draft problem statement and validate with both employees and other stakeholders

*Platform Evaluation*
- Research the available technology platforms made available by agencies’ IT department
- Evaluate using Open Opportunities to host both the pilot and the program

*Marketing Plan*
- Create an editorial calendar for posting digital and physical marketing material around the agency
- Contact your agency’s public relations and marketing department or outreach and communications department to determine the level of support they can provide to create collateral
- Determine how the team can include content in agency newsletters or announcements
- Ask to make announcements during any townhalls or agency-wide meetings
- Determine what materials located in the Marketing section of the Starter Kit the team would like to produce

*Pre-Launch Check*
- Create a form for new project and applications
- Validate that project can be created and submitted to the pilot
- Validate that applications can be created and submitted to the pilot
- Test any supervisor workflow if it’s been implemented
- Prepare pilot launch messages, emails, and announcements
- Determine application review process
- Validate analytics tracking for the pilot
