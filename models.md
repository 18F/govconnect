GovConnect has identified three models, based on best practices in Federal agencies and the private
sector. These are being tested by pilot agencies as part of Phase 1:

1. GovProject model (manager initiated micro-projects): Employees can apply their skills
and expertise on a part-time basis (e.g., up to 20 percent time) to support project
opportunities within the employee’s agency or in another Government agency. This model
is management-driven and supports the rapid deployment of cross-agency action teams to
respond to complex problems or time sensitive needs.
2. GovStart model (employee initiated micro-projects and professional networks):
Employees can identify talent quickly across their agencies or across Government based on
desired skillsets, to assemble part-time teams (e.g., up to 20 percent time) to work on
innovative initiatives and strengthen professional networks within and across agencies.
These micro-projects are grassroots, employee-driven as opposed to management-driven.
3. GovCloud model (Cloud-based skills deployment): Employees are hired by the Federal
Government and are detailed to agencies on a project-by-project basis to address critical
skills gaps. GovCloud employees may work on one project at a time or work on multiple
projects at once. Note: although the capacity to be “hired by the Federal government” in
lieu of a particular agency doesn’t yet formally exist, there are a number of ways to test
cross and intra-agency skills deployment in this manner, some of which are already
underway.
