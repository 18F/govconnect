When planning and designing an agile workforce pilot, there are several materials that will help a team stay organized and set the pilot up for greater participation and success.

##Project creation##

It is important that any project created and posted to the pilot program encourages others to apply and begin working on the posted project. One thing to consider is that project writing is hard; the description needs to provide enough information to allow an applicant to understand what the purpose of the project is and why they might want to apply to work on it. Below are some common tactics other programs have used to aid project creators in how to write a good project.

*Identifying projects*

* Does the current team not have the skills necessary to solve this problem?
* Does the problem require external input?
* Does the problem support virtual contributions?
* By collaborating on this project, does an employee expand their network?
* Does a solution to the problem has measureable outcomes of success?
* Can a team work on a solution in their “free time?"

*Writing new projects*

* Begin with an outline that lists the problem that needs to be solved, why it needs solving, what skills are needed to solve the problem, and how long it might take to solve the problem.
* Add more detail about the project so that the reader fully understands the problem, the need for a solution, and why applying to work on the project will benefit them.
* Describe who might be eligible to apply for the project.
* Define a start and end date.
* Define the size of the team the project would need to complete it

*Posting a new project*

* Market the project around the department and agency
* Create “what’s in it for me?” language to encourage people to apply
* Review new applications in a timely manner to prevent participants from losing interest

*Project feedback*

* Not performance review
* Freedom to take risks
* Focus on work done not the person
* Constructive feedback
* Articulate outcomes once project is completed

##Project management techniques##
Many program teams are leading their first project when they decide to head up a new agile workforce program. Several tools are available to help project leads determine what work needs to get done and when it makes since to establish deadlines for that work. To aid in planning and managing of the new program, below are some common techniques for managing a project:

###Project Plans###

###Milestones###

##Knowledge sharing and management##

While software and technology are important, knowledge is the main asset when developing a program — the tacit and explicit knowledge held by employees and embodied by the organization’s culture. Understanding and assessing your team’s process of creating and capturing, distributing and sharing knowledge is essential.

Key drivers for agencies to manage knowledge effectively in project development and implementation include:

* Reducing the time and effort spent in gathering required information for project execution
* Improving reusability or avoiding reinvention
* Reducing dependency on a few individuals for the project’s overall success
* Improving the overall project team’s productivity

To encourage widespread engagement throughout the team and to bolster the business case for the project, it is important to prove the concept within departments across the organization. Develop a Wiki devoted to the project to ensure knowledge management of best practices and lessons learned. Or, use other ways to curate or capture and disseminate knowledge and platforms to host this activity such as WordPress, SharePoint, Google Docs, or other tools your agency supports.
