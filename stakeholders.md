#Step 2: Working With Stakeholders#
The amount and types of stakeholders that are involved in a new agile workforce program differ based on the agency and overall scope of the program. These stakeholders include:
* Mentors
* Applicants
* Supervisors
* Senior Executive Leadership

The most important group of stakeholders however is the team behind the agile workforce program. This team doesn’t need to be large to do the design, planning, and launching of the program, however it does take one that is dedicated and engaged. Several key roles make up this program team:

###Program Lead(s)###
The program lead(s) are dedicated employees that desire to introduce a new way of working within their agency. These lead know that the current method of getting work done isn’t supporting the agency workforce anymore and a new way of working is needed to recruit and retain new staff, as well as meet the demands of the modern day.

###Program Sponsor###
Every agile workforce program needs one or more sponsors to help a program team gather the necessary information and to approve of their efforts. These sponsors will lower the internal barriers to assist the program team in meeting with other stakeholders around the agency and review the work products that team creates as it designs and plans the program. 

###Program Team Members###
Every program team needs helping hands to get a new program up and running. These are other employees who are passionate about getting an agile workforce program going at their agency. They may not be able to lead the initiative due to other work responsibilities, but may have a few spare hours in a week to lend a hand. 

It’s important that every program team takes the time to include the stakeholders described below to co-design the program together. This is vital for the program to have a human centered approach and to validate early concepts before they become fully established as core components of the agile workforce program. 

##Mentors and Mentorship##
Mentoring is usually a formal or an informal relationship between two people, which occurs for some time, usually between a senior employee and a junior protege’, usually someone who is not directly supervised by the mentor, according to an [OPM best-practices guide](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/training-and-development/career-development/bestpractices-mentoring.pdf).

Mentors are key in many instances to alerting colleagues about opportunities to expand their expertise and gain valuable professional development experience. The relationship affords an opportunity for knowledge sharing between inexperienced and senior team members and contributes to enhancing branding of the organization by signaling your organization values employee development. 

In the federal government, mentoring can be a precursor for additional career development or participation in formal programs including the Executive Leadership Program, the Presidential Management Program, and the Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program, according to OPM.

“Some mentor programs have flourished. The Environmental Protection Agency’s Skills Marketplace has become established within the EPA as an effective resource for managers. Open Opportunities has grown dramatically and is now open to all federal employees,” according to a [blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/01/govconnect-launch/) published by 18F about the GovConnect initiative.

The aim of GovConnect to help agency leaders connect their employees to innovative work on a part-time basis, to one another, and to their agency’s mission.

In a successful mentoring relationship, the mentor and mentee both find great satisfaction. Among the common outcomes are:

* Developed coaching and leadership skills for the mentor as well as reinforcement of their own knowledge and career goals
* An ability to grow for the mentee by experimenting, learning and trying new approaches in a safe environment

##Applicants##
A common mistake many pilot programs make is trying to create a program that is meant for every employee. While this is a good long-term goal, at first it’s best to focus on one or two specific types of applicants and project submitters. An artifact that can help a team determine who is the person they are creating this pilot for is a User Profile. These profiles should include basic demographic information about the type of person that would apply for a project or create a new project. Additionally, behavioral information should be included that speaks to why that type of person would want to apply for a project or create a new project. The below format can help teams quickly create the artifact and then use it to guide future decision on how the pilot should be planned, designed, and marketed.
