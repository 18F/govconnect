Many federal employees are required to create individual development plans. As they develop this tool to outline a career and professional path for themselves with their supervisors, GovConnect is an invaluable component to consider in the employee’s career development.

But what mechanisms already exist within the federal agency to alert new and current employees about advancement opportunities, career plans, and self-evaluation techniques that align them to the agency’s goals, mission, and objectives?

As continuous feedback is essential for a partnership between employees and their supervisors when it comes to career guidance, marketing the agile workforce initiative requires multiple approaches or phases to appeal to different stakeholders.

##Finding and Winning Support##
In order to attract attention, to encouragement enrollment and support from mid- and top-level leaders, internal champions will need to overtly leverage all the strengths and negotiating points of GovConnect.

In developing a brand strategy, solicit the support of your agency’s outreach, communications, multimedia and social media specialists. Your charge is to introduce not only a new program, but to re-introduce your agency as a niche brand for innovation in a particular subject or discipline - veterans’ affairs, energy, health and human services - or other core attributes - not only in your region but beyond.

GovConnect represents a way for employees to create strategic niche partnerships throughout their agencies and across the federal government.

In order to successfully claim this position, internal champions will need to calibrate the agency’s brand, bridging current market and audience expectations with existing attributes, assets and strengths that are true and authentic to your organization.

##Value Statements and Benefits##

Success for GovConnect will depend on the clear articulation – and operational delivery – of a well-defined value proposition.

Feedback (both in the research and in conversations among pilot program leaders and participants) suggested that their agencies needed to do a better job of describing and promoting its value proposition.

A strong and resonant brand idea has the power to unite employees around a true reflection of them as the brand, creating a sense of pride and forward momentum even in the face of challenges as the program expands.
