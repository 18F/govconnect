# Theory of Change

Assumption: The federal government needs a forward-thinking strategy and technological capability to develop and manage its greatest resource, its people, while positioning itself for the way people will work in the future (e.g., mobile, networked, virtual, short-term, project-based assignments).

Goal: **GovConnect** seeks to create a flatter, more agile and unified government and a skilled, mobile, connected, innovative, collaborative and responsive government workforce with 21st century skills.

## Key Objectives
(1) The GovConnect network provides both the program support and technological capability that encourages and enables:

* Enhanced employee engagement, innovation and productivity by giving employees access to the tools (and people) they need to efficiently share knowledge, collaborate and innovate.
* A strengthened knowledge base across the government
* Improved efficiency by reducing the time spent trying to locate the right people with the right skills

(2) Network effects and widespread use of this approach increases:

* Cost savings and increased depth of government expertise by reduced reliance on contractors.
* Rapid assembly of skills-based teams and deployment of talent within and across agencies.

(3) As the program scales with better support for agile teams, many supervisors and other leaders will use the platform as the default way to achieve mission objectives:  
* Improved efficiency by reducing the likelihood of duplicative projects and wasted resources by identifying others who are working on similar initiatives across agencies.

(4) As the program scales across agencies with better support for agile teams, it enables:
* A more rapid and effective response to critical events thereby providing better outcomes for the public and increasing public trust.

(5) which ultimately meets the goal, leading to:
* A flexible, talented pool of government employees who in addition to having depth of knowledge in their disciplines also have a breadth of experience across government.
* A collaborative, less hierarchical and non-silo’d environment where employees are encouraged to do what’s in the best interest of the government and the people it serves.
* More effective and nimble response to solve America’s most significant concerns.
