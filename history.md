title:  "History of GovConnect"
---

More than a year ago, the Office of Personnel Management launched a new approach to providing federal employees help and support in exploring innovative projects that not only excite them, but also net rewards for their organizations.

GovConnect empowers employees who want to work on passion projects without compromising their regular workload. It's not only designed to boost employee engagement, but it's also believed to enhance federal recruitment and hiring.

Early adopters play a major role evangelizing best practices that lead to improving employee experience as they work for the federal government. Among the ways they have advanced the initiative is by contributing to the creation of a [Starter Kit] (https://pages.18f.gov/govconnect/intro.html) for future agile workforce program leads and participants.
