title:  "Hypotheses"
---

GovConnect is applying an agile approach, collaborating with agencies to test the following hypotheses:

* Federal employees are willing to participate in additional projects or activities that they
are passionate about and/or are complementary to their skill-sets.
* Federal managers are willing to support their staff’s participation in projects in a different
part of their agency or in a different agency.
* Federal managers are willing to adopt an entrepreneurial approach to developing teams
from across their agencies or from other agencies to get their critical work done.
* A “bottom-up” approach where employees are empowered to start projects and initiatives,
find collaborators, and garner agency/department support increases employee
engagement.
* A “top-down” approach where managers garner support for projects, then open them to
employees to participate, is in the interest of Federal employees.
* Federal employees, with a GovConnect-like culture, can be more engaged and effective
than their colleagues in traditional Federal culture.
* Federal employees are able to broaden their professional networks through one or more of
the GovConnect models.
* Federal managers are able to reduce skills gaps through one or more of the GovConnect
models.
* Engagement can be measured through surveys (including specific Employee Viewpoint
Survey questions) and employee interviews. Effectiveness can be measured by the
number of innovative projects undertaken, the quality and/or speed at which they are
completed, the diversity of the teams participating, and the level of participation.
