GovConnect is currently conducting primary research based on the participants and
outcomes of the pilot and mentor agencies.  

This research has two goals. First, it will provide agencies involved with GovConnect best practices, pitfall warnings, and areas of opportunities for program improvement in Phase II. Second, it will provide agencies considering developing agile workforce approaches with a “Quick Start Guide” to help them launch. As part of this evaluation the research will also provide information on a variety of technology enablers that may be considered for GovConnect Phase II cross-agency pilots.

Having these practices in place will increase the probability that agencies will be successful in using agile workforce approaches. We believe increased adoption of these agile approaches will engage, empower and equip the 2.7 million federal employees to provide a significantly higher level of service to the American people.
