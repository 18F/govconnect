---
The Office of Personnel Management and the GovConnect community invites you to
start or join an agile workforce initiative at your agency.

This GovConnect Starter Kit serves agency leadership, individual employees, and teams that have a desire to create an agile workforce program within your organization with the necessary information and tools to build your own program. Teams can use this information to design and scale an agile workforce program.

The topics we'll cover include:

* Definition of an agile workforce program and how it supports your employees’ career development and your agency's mission;
* Advice on how to work with various stakeholders to gain their support and input on designing and advocating for the program;
* Insight into technological challenges and solutions you may encounter as the program evolves;
* Resources on how to market the program to participants, their supervisors, and other leaders; and
* Suggestions on using metrics to measure return on investment and the program’s overall success.
