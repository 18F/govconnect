#Step 3: Addressing Technology#
To ensure that an agile workforce program will work at any federal agency long term, it needs a technological catalyst to give employees the ability to post new projects as well as apply for them, independent of time or place.  During the pilot stage, the platform that hosts the program needs to be easy to use so that project posting and applications aren’t a purely manual process for which the agile team is responsible. The major role technology plays during the pilot phase of an agile workforce program is allowing for a healthy number for projects and applications to be processed, with automated tracking of metrics, so true business value can be calculated in addition to qualitative metrics and success stories from participants. 

Most agile teams will not have the technological background to build a new platform from scratch, so we’ve included a list of platforms that can used both during the pilot phase of a program, but also when it goes live. Each has its own pros and cons associated with them, but ultimately the deciding factors are what platform is the best fit for the overall purpose of your new agile workforce program and if it fits within your agency’s culture and organization. 

A chief task for prospective program adopters to do is conduct an inventory or to identify existing platforms. GovConnect Phase 1 pilots and mentor program laid much of this groundwork and a summary of that experience is included in this section. Also, inventory various examples of data analytics needed or technical requirements. Outlining this information will help you identify the platform that best meets your organization’s needs (and fits your tech requirements).

##Role of Technology##
During the pilot phase, technology is necessary to showcase the business and employee value of having an agile workforce program in place. Teams need a platform that will allow for a healthy number of projects to be hosted, and for employees to easily search for projects to apply for. A stable and well designed platform also lowers the barrier of entry for employees to participant and for supervisors to either create new project opportunities or to allow their staff to participate in the program. 

A successful pilot will have at least 50 projects with participants across different teams.  In practice, pilots typically have had 100-200 projects, as excitement has grown around the initiative.

It’s important to view any of these platforms as just a vehicle a tool that will allow for agile workforce programs to exist. The real work is the organization and culture change that needs to occur to allow the program to flourish.


##Available Platforms##
The platforms that are available to a team is dependent on internal IT policies and the type of agile workforce program that is desired. Does the team want the program to be internal only to a specific department or bureau, or does the team want something that is open for other agencies to access? 

###Open Opportunities###

**INSERT TWO SCREENSHOTS**

Open Opportunities is part of the Digital Gov initiative that allows any federal employee to create an account to post new project or to apply for any project listed. Used by GSA and the State Department, this platform is an example of a platform that operates across all federal agencies. 

######Pros######
* Already established with active user population
* Available to only federal employees
* Existing documentation on project creation and applying for projec
* Existing case studies and marketing materials, including supervisor support
* Available to be deployed for internal users only 
* The employee must declare if  supervisors are aware of their their activity

######Cons######
* Agency fees needed for supervisor notification and deploying for internal users only

###SharePoint###

SharePoint is a common platform for many agencies such as EPA, the Social Security Administration, and the Commerce Department where employees have access to create their own pages or sites. This allows for a program to take advantage of many of the integrations that came along with SharePoint, such as accessing Exchange Profiles to map employee and supervisor relationships. The process for getting a page or site launched to host the program does require assistance from your IT department. 

A custom solution built with SharePoint can include notification system to keep supervisors informed if employees apply for new project. This system can also track if a supervisor has approved an employee's desire to participant or not, which requires additional customization.

######Pros######
* A fully supported platform available to all agency employees
* Easy integration with Exchange profile to allow for supervisor approval workflow
* Can be integrated into an agency's intranet for greater exposure

######Cons######
* Requires IT support to deploy and maintain the program
* Requires knowledge of SharePoint to manage program page/site
* Dependent on IT release schedule for updates to program

###Other Platforms###

Additional platforms have been used to pilot programs successfully; however, these require significant manual labor and are only recommended if an agency has staff time, but no budget and has significant internal cultural barriers against using an open platform. These will require the team to be more hands on with the incoming project, applications, and updates on the project. These solutions are appropriate for teams that have limited support but still want to prove the value of an agile workforce program.

######Pros######
* Simple platforms that require little support from agency IT department
* Low investment to communicate the value of an agile workforce platform

######Cons######
* Not scalable to support an agency wide program
* Dependent on the amount of time administration team has to spend manually running the program
